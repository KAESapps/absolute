absolute
========

This is a JavaScript library of modular components whose purpose is to build complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for web browsers.

Current state of this library is still a _Work In Progress_. But the concept has been tested and validated in real-life applications.

It uses absolute positioning (position: absolute) for flexibility in UI design and performance reasons. Using this technique, we are able to build any complex, static or animated GUI ... and it's snappy.

You can build complex graphical components out of more basic ones, that can be found in this library.

_Documentation is also a WIP ..._
